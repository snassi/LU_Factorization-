# LU_Factorization-
Program written in C++ that calculates lower and upper triangular matrices (as well as determinant) from an input matrix of nXn dimensions.
This uses a Matrix and Array Class written by myself as well as Crout's Decomposition Algorithm in order to perform the tasks at hand.
Enjoy.
